Python PDF Editor is a simple script to display a menu in the console or command-line. Using this menu, you can merge all PDF (.pdf) files in a directory/folder into one, or you can manually select the files you would like to merge. Additionally, you can resize, encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt PDF files. While this program should function on all operating systems, I have only been able to test it on Windows.
<br><br>
The necessary files to run Python PDF Editor are:
<ul>
    <li>app.py</li>
    <li>utils.py</li>
    <li>data.json</li>
</ul>
To launch the console-based menu, run the app.py file from the command line, your IDE, or numerous other methods.
