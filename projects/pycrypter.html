PyCrypter is a light-weight alternative to <a href="projects/py-personal-vault">my PyPersonalVault project</a>. Designed to be started from the command line with or without arguments, PyCrypter performs fast encryption or decryption using AES with a salted version of the password. Multiple files can be selected for encryption or decryption in one run of the program, and each will generate a file with the same name (".bin" is added for encrypted files) as the original.
<br><br>
The necessary files to run PyCrypter are:
<ul>
    <li>app.py</li>
    <li>utils.py</li>
    <li>encryption_utils.py</li>
</ul>
