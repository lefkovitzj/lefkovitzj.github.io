ACM Meeting Records is a Python-based web application that allows for management of meetings for the student chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery at the University of Dayton, where I currently serve as Vice President of the organization. This web app allows administrators to record meeting minutes, add attendees, create, update, and end meetings. Other organization members can mark attendance with a meeting passcode and view historical meeting information.
