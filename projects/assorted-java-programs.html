A collection of small Java programs created for a Computer Science class.
Sorted alphabetically, here is a list of the different Java projects with a brief description of what each one does:
<ol>
    <li>Account.java - Contains a class to represent a bank account and containing methods to simulate withdrawals, deposits, setting the account balance, getting account information, and calculating monthly interest rate from the given annual interest rate (among other minor methods). Test these methods in the "main" function with predetirmined data.</li><br>
    <li>BabyNames.java - Load the data file (<a href="https://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/data/babynameranking2001.txt"  target="_blank">located at https://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/data/babynameranking2001.txt <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>) and list all of the popular baby names that were used for both genders.</li><br>
    <li>CircleClass.java - Contains a class to represent a circle and containing methods to get the area, find the perimiter, detect if a point is within the circle, and detirmine if another circle overlaps with the first circle. Test these methods in the "main" function with predetirmined data.</li><br>
    <li>ConsecutiveEqualNumbers.java - Create and populate a two-dimensional array. The program then will search it for four consecutive (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) equal numbers and display whether or not such a case exists within the two-dimensional array.</li><br>
    <li>CreditCardValidation.java - Check whether an entered number could be a credit card number and display the result.</li><br>
    <li>FutureValue.java - Calculate the future value of an investment based off of user input representing the initial investment amount, the annual interest rate, and duration of the investment.</li><br>
    <li>LoanComparison.java - Based off of original loan amount and duration of the loan, calculate and display the monthly payment and total loan cost for various interest rates.</li><br>
    <li>PhoneKeypads.java - Converts any alphabet character or numerical character to a number (as is often labeled on landline phones), and display the binary of that number.</li><br>
    <li>TaxComputation.java - Calculate the federal income tax based off of defined criteria for different tax brackets.</li>
