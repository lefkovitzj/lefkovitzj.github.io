PyPersonalVault is a file encryption application built in Python. It allows users to securely encrypt their files (any filetypes except .py and PyPersonalVault-related files should work) with a password. Multiple seperate vaults can be created, with each having a seperate password.
<br><br>The graphical user interface (GUI) is built with TKinter and CustomTkinter (pip install customtkinter). Cryptographic algorithms are sourced from the RSA, AES, and SHA3_256 portions of the PyCryptodome package (pip install pycryptodomex), and various Python Standard Library modules are used throughout. Many thanks to the developers of and contributors to these excellent tools!
<br><br>Currently on version 1.0.0, PyPersonal Vault allows creation of multiple vaults, file encryption using a specific vault and password, and file decryption using the same vault and password used in encrypting the file.
<br><br>Possible features for future updates to PyPersonalVault include:
<ol>
    <li>Displaying a list of all files encrypted by a specific PyPersonalVault.</li>
    <li>Delete a PyPersonalVault.</li>
    <li>Change username and/or password for a PyPersonalVault.</li>
    <li>Encrypt and decrypt all files in a folder at once.</li>
    <li>A command-line version of the application.</li>
</ol>
<br>
The necessary files to run PyPersonalVault are:
<ul>
    <li>app.py</li>
    <li>utils.py</li>
    <li>application_data.json</li>
    <li>license.txt</li>
</ul>
If any file is missing, the application will inform the user on startup and will provide a button that links to this project repository. If data is corrupted, a similar message will be displayed. All files are necessary for the project to permit the user to run core functionality.
